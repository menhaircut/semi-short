Make sure to place the hutch in a shaded or cool area to avoid heat exhaustion and provide ample bedding to keep your rabbit warm.</p><h3>Diet</h3><p>Rabbits need a balanced diet that's rich in hay, vegetables, and fruits.

Make sure to avoid cutting the quick, which is the pink part of the nail that contains blood vessels.</p><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Are rabbits high maintenance?</h3><p>It depends on the breed and the rabbit's age, health, and personality.

Use a curling iron or wand</h3><p>The easiest way to create curls is to use a curling iron or wand. Choose a barrel size that matches the size of the curls you want, and wrap sections of hair around the barrel, holding for a few seconds before releasing. For big, loose curls, use a larger barrel, and for tighter, more defined curls, use a smaller barrel.</p><h3>2. Try hot rollers</h3><p>Hot rollers are another great way to add curls to your hair. Roll sections of hair onto the rollers and leave them in until they cool. Remove the rollers and run your fingers through your hair to loosen the curls and create volume.</p><h3>3. Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer</h3><p>A diffuser attachment on your hair dryer can help enhance your natural curls and add volume. Use it on a low heat setting and scrunch your hair as you dry it.</p><h3>4. Use a volumizing mousse or spray</h3><p>Volumizing products can help create lift and body in your hair.

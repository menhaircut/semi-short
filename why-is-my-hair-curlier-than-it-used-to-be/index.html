After washing your hair, gently squeeze out the excess water with a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt. Avoid rubbing your hair with a regular towel, as this can cause frizz. 3. Apply a leave-in conditioner or curl cream to your damp hair. This will help define your curls and keep them moisturized. 4. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair. Start at the ends and work your way up to the roots. 5. If you want to blow-dry your hair, use a diffuser attachment to enhance your curls. Hold the diffuser close to your head and use a low heat setting. 6. Avoid touching your hair too much throughout the day. This can cause frizz and disrupt your curl pattern. <h2>Tips</h2> - Use a silk or satin pillowcase to help reduce frizz and breakage while you sleep. - Consider using a hair mask once a week to help nourish and moisturize your hair. - Experiment with different styling products to find what works best for your hair type and curl pattern. - Avoid using hair elastics that can cause breakage. Instead, use hair clips or scrunchies to secure your hair. - If you're dealing with dry or damaged hair, try using a deep conditioning treatment once a month to help restore moisture. <h2>FAQ</h2> Q: Why is my hair curlier than it used to be?

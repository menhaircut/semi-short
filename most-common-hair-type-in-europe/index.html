It can also be found in other parts of Europe, but it is less common than straight or wavy hair. Curly hair can range from loose waves to tight coils and requires extra care to prevent frizz and maintain definition. <h3>Thick Hair</h3> Thick hair is common in many parts of Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe.

If you have thick curly hair, you know how challenging it can be to style and manage. One of the best solutions to tame your curls and achieve sleek, straight locks is by using a straightener. However, not all straighteners are created equal, especially when it comes to thick curly hair. In this guide, we'll help you find the best straightener for thick curly hair 2020, and provide tips on how to use it effectively. </p><h2> How to Choose the Best Straightener for Thick Curly Hair </h2><p>Before we dive into the top straighteners for thick curly hair, let's discuss the factors you should consider when choosing one. </p><h3> Plate Material </h3><p>The plate material is one of the most important factors to consider when buying a straightener. It determines how well the straightener will work on your hair, and its durability. </p><p>For thick curly hair, ceramic or ceramic tourmaline plates are the best option. They distribute heat evenly, reduce frizz, and leave your hair shiny and smooth. Titanium plates are also a good choice, but they can get very hot, which can damage your hair if not used properly. </p><h3> Plate Width </h3><p>The plate width is another important factor to consider. If you have thick hair, you should choose a straightener with wider plates. This will help you cover more hair with each pass, which will save you time and reduce heat damage. </p><h3> Temperature Settings </h3><p>Thick curly hair requires higher temperatures to straighten effectively. Look for a straightener with adjustable temperature settings, so you can find the right heat level for your hair type. </p><h2> Top 5 Straighteners for Thick Curly Hair 2020 </h2><p>Now that you know what to look for in a straightener, let's take a look at the best options for thick curly hair in 2020. </p><h3> 1. BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium-Plated Ultra-Thin Straightening Iron </h3><p>The BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium-Plated Ultra-Thin Straightening Iron is a top-rated option for thick curly hair. Its titanium plates heat up quickly and evenly, and its ultra-thin design makes it easy to handle. It also has adjustable temperature settings up to 450°F, making it suitable for all hair types. </p><h3> 2. HSI Professional Glider </h3><p>The HSI Professional Glider is another great straightener for thick curly hair. Its ceramic tourmaline plates distribute heat evenly, and its temperature settings range from 140°F to 450°F. It also comes with a heat-resistant glove and a travel pouch for convenience. </p><h3> 3. ghd Platinum+ Professional Performance Styler </h3><p>The ghd Platinum+ Professional Performance Styler is a high-end straightener that's worth the investment. Its ceramic plates are infused with platinum, which provides even heat distribution and reduces breakage. It also has predictive technology that adjusts the temperature to your hair's needs, making it a great option for thick curly hair. </p><h3> 4. Remington Wet2Straight Flat Iron </h3><p>The Remington Wet2Straight Flat Iron is a unique option that can be used on wet or dry hair. Its ceramic plates heat up quickly and evenly, and it has adjustable temperature settings up to 420°F. It also has steam vents that allow you to straighten your hair while it's still damp, saving you time and reducing heat damage. </p><h3> 5. CHI Original 1" Flat Hair Straightening Ceramic Hairstyling Iron </h3><p>The CHI Original 1" Flat Hair Straightening Ceramic Hairstyling Iron is a classic option that's been around for years. Its ceramic plates distribute heat evenly, and its temperature settings range from 180°F to 410°F. It also has a 9-foot swivel cord for easy maneuverability. </p><h2> How to Straighten Thick Curly Hair </h2><p>Now that you have the right straightener for your hair, it's time to learn how to use it effectively. Here are some tips to help you get the best results. </p><h3> 1. Start with Clean, Dry Hair </h3><p>Straightening dirty or wet hair can cause damage and frizz. Make sure your hair is clean and completely dry before using your straightener. </p><h3> 2. Use Heat Protectant </h3><p>Applying a heat protectant before straightening can help reduce damage and keep your hair healthy. Spray it evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the ends. </p><h3> 3. Section Your Hair </h3><p>Divide your hair into small sections, starting at the bottom. This will make it easier to straighten each strand and ensure that you don't miss any areas. </p><h3> 4. Use a Comb </h3><p>Before straightening each section, use a comb to detangle it. This will help you achieve a smoother finish and prevent snagging. </p><h3> 5. Take Your Time </h3><p>Straightening thick curly hair can take time, so be patient. Don't rush through the process, as this can cause damage and reduce the effectiveness of the straightener. </p><h2> FAQs </h2><h3> 1. Can I use a straightener on wet hair? </h3><p>No, it's not recommended to use a straightener on wet hair. Wet hair is more susceptible to damage, and using a straightener on it can cause breakage and frizz. </p><h3> 2. How often should I straighten my hair? </h3><p>It's best to limit straightening to once or twice a week to prevent damage. </p><h3> 3. Can I straighten my hair without a heat protectant? </h3><p>No, using a heat protectant is essential to prevent damage and keep your hair healthy. </p><h2> Hair Care Tips for Thick Curly Hair </h2><p>Aside from using the right straightener, taking care of your hair is also important. Here are some tips to keep your thick curly hair healthy and manageable. </p><h3> 1. Use a Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner </h3><p>Thick curly hair is prone to dryness, so using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner can help keep it hydrated. Look for products that contain natural oils, such as coconut or argan oil. </p><h3> 2. Avoid Heat Styling </h3><p>If possible, avoid heat styling your hair frequently. This can cause damage and make your hair more difficult to manage. </p><h3> 3. Use a Wide-Tooth Comb </h3><p>Avoid using a brush on your hair, as this can cause breakage and frizz. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair. </p><h3> 4. Deep Condition Once a Week </h3><p>Deep conditioning once a week can help nourish your hair and keep it healthy. Apply a hair mask or deep conditioner to your hair, focusing on the ends. Leave it on for at least 15 minutes before rinsing. </p><h3> 5. Avoid Tight Hairstyles </h3><p>Wearing your hair in tight hairstyles, such as ponytails or braids, can cause breakage and damage. Try to avoid these styles or wear them loosely. </p><p>With the right straightener and proper hair care, you can achieve sleek, straight locks with ease. Follow these tips and recommendations to find the best straightener for thick curly hair 2020 and keep your hair healthy and manageable. </p></article>

They're perfect for busy people who don't have a lot of time to spend with their pets. These dogs are also great for those who live in apartments or small spaces.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>When looking for a low maintenance dog, it's important to consider the breed's temperament, energy level, and size. Some breeds that are great for people who work long hours include:</p><h3>1. Chihuahua</h3><p>Chihuahuas are small dogs that are perfect for apartment living. They require minimal grooming and exercise and are content to spend most of their time curled up on your lap or in their bed.</p><h3>2. Basset Hound</h3><p>Basset hounds are known for their laid-back personalities and their love of napping. They don't require a lot of exercise and are content to spend most of their time lounging around the house.</p><h3>3. Greyhound</h3><p>Greyhounds are known for their speed, but they're also great low maintenance dogs. They don't require a lot of exercise and are content to spend most of their time sleeping or relaxing.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Once you've decided on a low maintenance dog that can be left alone, it's important to make sure they're comfortable while you're away.

Hire a Dog Walker</h3><p>If you work long hours, consider hiring a dog walker to come in and take your dog for a walk during the day. This will give them some much-needed exercise and a chance to get out of the house.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when caring for a low maintenance dog:</p><h3>1. Regular Check-Ups</h3><p>Even though your dog may be low maintenance, it's still important to take them to the vet for regular check-ups to make sure they're healthy.</p><h3>2.

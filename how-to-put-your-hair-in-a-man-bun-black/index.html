Keep wrapping until you reach the end of your hair. Tuck the end under the bun to secure it in place. <h3>Step 5: Secure with a Hair Tie</h3> Use another hair tie to secure the bun in place. Make sure it's tight enough to keep the bun in place, but not so tight that it hurts. <h3>Step 6: Finish with Hair Spray (Optional)</h3> If you want to keep your man bun black looking sharp all day, finish with a spritz of hair spray.

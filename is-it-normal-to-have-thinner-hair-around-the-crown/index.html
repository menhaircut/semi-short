Here are some of the most common causes:</p><h3>1. Genetic Factors</h3><p>Genetics can play a significant role in the thickness and density of your hair. If your family members have thinning hair around the crown, you may be more likely to experience the same condition.</p><h3>2. Age</h3><p>As we age, our hair naturally becomes thinner, finer, and less dense. This is because the hair follicles shrink over time and produce hair that is shorter and thinner than before.</p><h3>3. Hormonal Changes</h3><p>Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy, menopause, or thyroid disorders, can also cause thinning hair around the crown. Hormonal imbalances can affect the growth and thickness of your hair.</p><h3>4.

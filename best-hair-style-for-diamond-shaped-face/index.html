You want to accentuate your unique features while also finding a style that flatters your face shape. In this article, we will discuss the best hair style for diamond shaped face, as well as provide tips and tricks on how to care for your hair.</p><h2>Description: What is a Diamond Shaped Face?</h2><p>A diamond shaped face is characterized by a narrow forehead and jawline, with wide cheekbones. This face shape is often considered to be the most dramatic and angular of all the face shapes. The goal when choosing a hairstyle for this face shape is to soften the angles and create balance.</p><h2>How to Determine if You Have a Diamond Shaped Face?</h2><p>To determine if you have a diamond shaped face, take a close look at your face in the mirror. If you have wide cheekbones, a narrow forehead and jawline, and a pointed chin, then you have a diamond shaped face. This face shape is also sometimes referred to as a “triangle” face shape.</p><h2>The Best Hair Style for Diamond Shaped Face</h2><p>The best hair style for diamond shaped face is one that softens the angles of your face and creates balance. Here are some hairstyles that are perfect for this face shape:</p><h3>1. Shoulder-Length Bob</h3><p>A shoulder-length bob is an excellent choice for diamond shaped faces as it softens the angles and draws attention to the eyes. This hairstyle works best with a side-part, which helps to create balance.</p><h3>2. Long Layers</h3><p>Long layers are another great option for diamond shaped faces. They add volume to the hair and create a soft, feminine look. This hairstyle works well with a center-part or a deep side-part.</p><h3>3. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs are a great way to soften the angles of a diamond shaped face. They draw attention to the eyes and create a more balanced look.</p><h3>4. Pixie Cut</h3><p>A pixie cut is a bold choice, but it can work well with a diamond shaped face. The short hair draws attention to the eyes and cheekbones, creating balance and softening the angles of the face.</p><h3>5.

Leave it on overnight and wash it off with a mild shampoo in the morning. Repeat this process two to three times a week until you see results.</p><h3>2. Castor Oil and Coconut Oil</h3><p>Mix equal parts of castor oil and coconut oil and apply it to your scalp. Massage it gently for a few minutes and leave it on for at least an hour before washing it off. This mixture not only promotes hair growth but also conditions and strengthens your hair.</p><h3>3.

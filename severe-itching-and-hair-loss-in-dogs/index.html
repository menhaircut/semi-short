If you suspect that your dog has an allergy, it's important to see a veterinarian for treatment.</p><h3>Parasites</h3><p>Dogs can be infested with a variety of parasites, including fleas, ticks, mites, and lice.

It's important to keep your dog's fur clean and to use flea and tick prevention products to avoid infestations.</p><h3>Fungal Infections</h3><p>Dogs can develop fungal infections of the skin and hair, such as ringworm. These infections can cause severe itching and hair loss, as well as other symptoms such as redness, scaling, and crusting. Fungal infections can be treated with antifungal medications prescribed by a veterinarian.</p><h3>Hormonal Imbalances</h3><p>Hormonal imbalances can cause hair loss in dogs, especially in certain breeds such as Pomeranians and Chihuahuas.

Use a mild shampoo formulated for dogs, and rinse thoroughly to avoid leaving any residue.</p><h3>Brush Their Coat Regularly</h3><p>Regular brushing can help to remove loose hair and debris from your dog's coat, as well as distribute natural oils that can help to keep their skin healthy. Use a brush that is appropriate for your dog's coat type, and be gentle to avoid causing further irritation.</p><h3>Use Conditioner</h3><p>Using a conditioner after shampooing can help to soothe your dog's skin and coat, as well as make their fur softer and more manageable. Look for a conditioner that is formulated for dogs, and follow the instructions carefully.</p><h3>Feed Them a Healthy Diet</h3><p>A healthy diet can help to keep your dog's coat healthy and shiny. Make sure that your dog is getting a balanced diet that is appropriate for their age, breed, and activity level. Consider adding supplements such as omega-3 fatty acids or biotin to support their skin and coat health.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ About Severe Itching and Hair Loss in Dogs</h2><h3>Q: Can severe itching and hair loss be a sign of a serious condition?</h3><p>A: Yes, severe itching and hair loss can be a sign of a serious condition such as an allergy or hormonal imbalance.

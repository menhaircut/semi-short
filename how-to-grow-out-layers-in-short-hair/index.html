Growing out layers in short hair can be challenging, but it is possible with the right techniques and hair care routine. In this article, we will discuss how to grow out layers in short hair, step by step.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Short hair with layers can be an excellent look, but as it grows, it can become difficult to manage.

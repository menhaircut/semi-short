It's a popular trend that can help you achieve a more defined and sculpted look. However, contouring can be overwhelming, especially if you're new to the game. In this post, we'll walk you through how to contour face shapes like a pro. </p><h2> Table of Contents </h2><ul><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to Contour Face Shapes</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Contouring</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs About Contouring</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care Tips to Complement Your Contoured Look</a></li></ul><h2 id="description"> Description </h2><p> Contouring is a makeup technique that involves using different shades of makeup to create the illusion of shadows and highlights on your face. The darker shades are used to create shadows, while the lighter shades are used to create highlights. When done correctly, contouring can help make your face appear more defined and sculpted. </p><h2 id="how-to"> How to Contour Face Shapes </h2><p> If you're new to contouring, it can be challenging to know where to start. Here are a few tips to help you get started: </p><h3> Determine Your Face Shape </h3><p> Before you start contouring, it's essential to determine your face shape. There are six basic face shapes: round, oval, square, heart, diamond, and long. Each face shape requires a different contouring technique to achieve the desired look. </p><h3> Choose the Right Products </h3><p> Choosing the right products is essential when it comes to contouring. You'll need a contour shade that's a few shades darker than your natural skin tone and a highlight shade that's a few shades lighter. You'll also need a blending brush, a powder brush, and a beauty blender. </p><h3> Apply the Contour Shade </h3><p> Once you've chosen your products, it's time to apply the contour shade. Start by applying the contour shade to the areas of your face that you want to shade. These areas typically include the hollows of your cheeks, your temples, and your jawline. </p><h3> Apply the Highlight Shade </h3><p> After you've applied the contour shade, it's time to apply the highlight shade. Apply the highlight shade to the areas of your face that you want to highlight. These areas typically include the tops of your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, and your cupid's bow. </p><h3> Blend, Blend, Blend </h3><p> The key to successful contouring is blending. You'll want to blend the contour and highlight shades until there are no harsh lines or visible demarcations. Use your blending brush, powder brush, and beauty blender to blend the shades seamlessly into your skin. </p><h2 id="step-by-step"> Step-by-Step Guide </h2><p> Now that you know the basics of contouring, here's a step-by-step guide to help you contour your face shape: </p><h3> Round Face </h3><p> If you have a round face, you'll want to create the illusion of angles and definition. Start by applying the contour shade to the hollows of your cheeks, your temples, and your jawline. Apply the highlight shade to the tops of your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, and your cupid's bow. Blend the shades thoroughly, focusing on the edges of your face. </p><h3> Oval Face </h3><p> If you have an oval face, you're in luck! You have a naturally balanced face shape, so you don't need to do much contouring. Apply the contour shade to the hollows of your cheeks and your temples. Apply the highlight shade to the tops of your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, and your cupid's bow. Blend the shades thoroughly for a natural look. </p><h3> Square Face </h3><p> If you have a square face, you'll want to soften your angles and create a more rounded look. Apply the contour shade to the corners of your jawline, the hollows of your cheeks, and your temples. Apply the highlight shade to the tops of your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, and your cupid's bow. Blend the shades thoroughly, focusing on the edges of your face. </p><h3> Heart-Shaped Face </h3><p> If you have a heart-shaped face, you'll want to balance your forehead and create a more defined jawline. Apply the contour shade to the corners of your jawline and the temples. Apply the highlight shade to the tops of your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, and your cupid's bow. Blend the shades thoroughly, focusing on the edges of your face. </p><h3> Diamond Face </h3><p> If you have a diamond face, you'll want to soften your angles and create a more rounded look. Apply the contour shade to the corners of your jawline, the hollows of your cheeks, and your temples. Apply the highlight shade to the tops of your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, and your cupid's bow. Blend the shades thoroughly, focusing on the edges of your face. </p><h3> Long Face </h3><p> If you have a long face, you'll want to create the illusion of width and balance. Apply the contour shade to the corners of your jawline, the hollows of your cheeks, and your temples. Apply the highlight shade to the tops of your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, and your cupid's bow. Blend the shades thoroughly, focusing on the edges of your face. </p><h2 id="tips"> Tips for Contouring </h2><p> Here are a few tips to help you master the art of contouring: </p><ul><li>Start with a light hand and build up the product gradually. </li><li>Use natural light to ensure you're applying the shades correctly. </li><li>Blend, blend, blend! </li><li>Set your contour with a powder to ensure it lasts all day. </li><li>Practice makes perfect!

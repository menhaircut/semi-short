This problem can occur for a variety of reasons, from genetics to styling habits to the environment. But don't worry – we're here to help! In this article, we'll go over how to deal with hair on top of head that sticks up, including tips, tricks, and hair care advice.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>First, let's define what we mean by hair on top of head that sticks up. This is when the hair on the crown of your head or around your part line refuses to lay flat, no matter how much you try to smooth it down. This can create a look that is messy, unkempt, or just plain annoying. It can also be more pronounced in certain hair types, such as curly, thick, or coarse hair.</p><h2>How to Fix Hair on Top of Head That Sticks Up</h2><p>If you're dealing with hair on top of head that sticks up, there are a few things you can try to fix the problem:</p><h3>1. Change Your Styling Habits</h3><p>The way you style your hair can have a big impact on whether it sticks up or lays flat. Here are some tips to try:</p><ul><li>Use a smoothing serum or cream before blow-drying to help tame flyaways.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair in the opposite direction of where it naturally falls to create volume and smoothness.</li><li>Use a flat iron or straightening brush to smooth out any kinks or bumps.</li></ul><h3>2. Adjust Your Haircut or Part Line</h3><p>Sometimes, the way your hair is cut or parted can contribute to it sticking up. Here are some ideas to try:</p><ul><li>Ask your stylist to cut your hair in a way that creates more weight or volume on top to help it lay flatter.</li><li>Experiment with different part lines to see if a different placement helps your hair lay flatter.</li><li>Try adding layers or texture to your hair to create movement and volume that can help disguise any sticking up pieces.</li></ul><h3>3. Use the Right Hair Products</h3><p>The products you use on your hair can also make a big difference in how it behaves. Here are some product recommendations to try:</p><ul><li>Use a volumizing mousse or spray at the roots to create lift and volume that can help your hair lay flatter.</li><li>Try a hairspray or pomade that provides a strong hold to help keep your hair in place.</li><li>Avoid using heavy or greasy products that can weigh down your hair and make it more likely to stick up.</li></ul><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Fixing Hair on Top of Head That Sticks Up</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to fixing hair on top of head that sticks up:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are suited to your hair type.

Blow-dry your hair in the opposite direction of where it naturally falls to create lift at the roots.</p><h3>Step 4: Use a Flat Iron or Straightening Brush</h3><p>If necessary, use a flat iron or straightening brush to smooth out any kinks or bumps in your hair.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray or Pomade</h3><p>Finish your style with a strong-hold hairspray or pomade to help keep your hair in place.</p><h2>Tips for Preventing Hair on Top of Head from Sticking Up</h2><p>Here are some tips for preventing hair on top of head from sticking up in the first place:</p><ul><li>Get regular haircuts to help keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends that can create flyaways.</li><li>Use a satin pillowcase to reduce friction and prevent hair breakage while you sleep.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools like flat irons or curling irons too often, as they can damage your hair and make it more prone to sticking up.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Why does hair on top of head stick up?</h3><p>Hair on top of head can stick up for a variety of reasons, including genetics, styling habits, and environmental factors like humidity.</p><h3>Can hair on top of head that sticks up be fixed?</h3><p>Yes, hair on top of head that sticks up can usually be fixed with the right styling techniques, products, and haircuts.</p><h3>What are some good products for preventing hair on top of head from sticking up?</h3><p>Good products for preventing hair on top of head from sticking up include smoothing serums, volumizing mousses, and strong-hold hairsprays or pomades.</p><h2>Hair Care for Hair on Top of Head That Sticks Up</h2><p>To keep your hair healthy and prevent it from sticking up, make sure to:</p><ul><li>Wash and condition your hair regularly with products that are suited to your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools like flat irons or curling irons too often, as they can damage your hair and make it more prone to sticking up.</li><li>Get regular haircuts to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends that can create flyaways.</li></ul><p>By following these tips and techniques, you can finally say goodbye to hair on top of head that sticks up and hello to a smooth, sleek style that looks great every day.</p></article>

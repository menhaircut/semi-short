Quora</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>If you're not a professional hairstylist, it can be tough to keep up with all the latest trends and terminology. You might see a celebrity sporting a sleek new 'do and wonder, "What's this hairstyle called?" Or maybe you've been scrolling through Pinterest and stumbled upon a look that you love, but have no idea how to describe it to your stylist.</p><p>In this guide, we'll break down some of the most popular hairstyles and give them easy-to-understand names. Whether you're looking for a new cut, color, or updo, we've got you covered.</p><h2>The Lob</h2><p>The lob, or long bob, is a popular hairstyle that falls just above the shoulders. It's a versatile cut that can be worn straight, wavy, or curly, and is great for those who want a shorter style without going too extreme. To get the look, ask your stylist for a blunt cut with subtle layers.</p><h3>How to Style a Lob</h3><p>To style your lob, start by washing your hair and applying a heat protectant. Blow dry your hair using a round brush to add volume and smooth out any kinks. If you want to add waves, use a curling iron or wand to create loose, beachy curls. Finish with a texturizing spray for a lived-in look.</p><h3>Tips for Maintaining a Lob</h3><p>To keep your lob looking fresh, get regular trims every 6-8 weeks. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to prevent dryness and breakage. Avoid using hot tools every day, and opt for air-drying whenever possible.</p><h3>FAQ</h3><p>Q: Can a lob work for any face shape?</p><p>A: Yes! A lob can be customized to flatter any face shape, whether you have a round, square, or heart-shaped face.</p><h2>The Balayage</h2><p>The balayage is a highlighting technique that creates a natural, sun-kissed look. Instead of using foils, the stylist will paint the color onto the hair freehand, creating a more blended effect. It's a great option for those who want to add dimension to their hair without going for a full-on color change.</p><h3>How to Get a Balayage</h3><p>To get a balayage, your stylist will start by sectioning your hair and painting the color onto the strands. They may use a lightener or a demi-permanent color, depending on your desired result. Once the color is applied, it will be left to process, then rinsed out and styled.</p><h3>Tips for Maintaining a Balayage</h3><p>To keep your balayage looking fresh, use a color-safe shampoo and conditioner. Avoid using hot tools too often, and always use a heat protectant when you do. If you're going to be spending a lot of time in the sun, wear a hat or use a UV protectant spray to prevent fading.</p><h3>FAQ</h3><p>Q: Can you get a balayage on dark hair?</p><p>A: Yes! Balayage can work on any hair color, but it will show up best on hair that is at least a few shades lighter than your natural color.</p><h2>The Top Knot</h2><p>The top knot is a simple and stylish updo that's perfect for those days when you don't have time to wash your hair. It's quick and easy to do, and can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion.</p><h3>How to Do a Top Knot</h3><p>To do a top knot, start by pulling your hair up into a high ponytail. Twist the ponytail around itself to create a bun, then secure it with bobby pins. If you want a messier look, pull out a few strands of hair around your face.</p><h3>Tips for Maintaining a Top Knot</h3><p>To keep your top knot looking neat, use a smoothing serum or oil to tame any flyaways. Use a dry shampoo between washes to keep your hair looking fresh and voluminous. And don't be afraid to experiment with different accessories, like headbands or scarves, to add some extra flair.</p><h3>FAQ</h3><p>Q: Can you do a top knot with short hair?</p><p>A: Yes! If your hair is too short to pull into a high ponytail, try a half-up version by pulling the top section of your hair back into a mini-bun.</p><h2>The Pixie Cut</h2><p>The pixie cut is a short and sassy hairstyle that's perfect for those who want to make a bold statement. It's a low-maintenance cut that's easy to style, but requires regular trims to maintain its shape.</p><h3>How to Style a Pixie Cut</h3><p>To style your pixie cut, start by washing your hair and towel-drying it. Apply a styling product, like a pomade or wax, to add texture and hold. Use your fingers to tousle your hair, or use a comb to create a sleeker look. For extra volume, blow dry your hair using a round brush.</p><h3>Tips for Maintaining a Pixie Cut</h3><p>To keep your pixie cut looking sharp, get regular trims every 4-6 weeks. Use a lightweight conditioner to prevent your hair from becoming too weighed down. And if you're feeling adventurous, experiment with different hair accessories, like headbands or clips.</p><h3>FAQ</h3><p>Q: Can a pixie cut work for curly hair?</p><p>A: Yes! A pixie cut can work for any hair texture, but may require some extra styling products to keep curly hair under control.</p><h2>The Beach Waves</h2><p>Beach waves are a popular hairstyle that's perfect for those who want a relaxed, bohemian look. It's a low-maintenance style that can be achieved with minimal effort.</p><h3>How to Get Beach Waves</h3><p>To get beach waves, start by washing your hair and towel-drying it. Apply a texturizing spray or mousse to add volume and texture. Divide your hair into sections, and use a curling iron or wand to curl each section away from your face. Once all the sections are curled, shake out your hair and run your fingers through it to create a natural, tousled look.</p><h3>Tips for Maintaining Beach Waves</h3><p>To keep your beach waves looking fresh, use a salt spray or dry shampoo to add texture and hold. Avoid using hot tools too often, and let your hair air-dry whenever possible. And if you're heading to the beach, embrace the natural texture and let your hair go wild!</p><h3>FAQ</h3><p>Q: Can you get beach waves on short hair?</p><p>A: Yes! To get beach waves on short hair, use a curling iron or wand to create loose curls, then run your fingers through them to create a tousled look.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know what these popular hairstyles are called, you can confidently ask your stylist for the look you want. Remember to take care of your hair by using high-quality products and getting regular trims. And most importantly, have fun experimenting with different styles and looks!</p></article>

Use the comb to guide the clippers along your hair, working your way up towards the top of your head. Be sure to use a steady hand and take your time to ensure a clean, even cut.</p><h3>Step 6: Blend Your Hair</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting your hair, use your scissors to blend any uneven areas or to create layers. Be sure to take your time and work carefully to avoid any mistakes.</p><h3>Step 7: Clean Up</h3><p>After you've finished cutting your hair, take some time to clean up any loose hairs and to wash your clippers and other supplies.

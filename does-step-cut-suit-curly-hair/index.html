This haircut can add volume and texture to straight hair, but it can also work well for curly hair.</p><p>However, not all step cuts are created equal. The key to making a step cut work for curly hair is to make sure the layers are cut in a way that enhances the natural curl pattern and doesn't create too much volume or frizz.

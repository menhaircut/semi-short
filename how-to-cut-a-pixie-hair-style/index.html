Make sure your hair is completely dry before you start cutting. <h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3> Use clips to section off your hair into manageable sections. Start at the back of your head, and work your way forward. <h3>Step 4: Cut the Back and Sides</h3> Using sharp scissors, start cutting the hair at the back of your head. Work your way up to the sides, cutting the hair in small sections. Use a comb to hold the hair in place as you cut, and make sure to cut in a straight line. <h3>Step 5: Cut the Top</h3> Once you've cut the sides and back, it's time to move on to the top. Use the comb to lift sections of hair, and then cut in a straight line. You can choose to cut the hair shorter or longer, depending on the style you're going for. <h3>Step 6: Blend and Texture</h3> Once you've cut all of your hair, it's time to blend and texture the hair to create a more natural look. Use thinning shears or scissors to create texture, and blend the hair using your fingers. <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2> - If you're not confident in cutting your own hair, it's always best to go to a professional stylist. - Take your time and work in small sections to ensure an even cut. - Use clips to keep the hair in place as you cut. - Use thinning shears or scissors to create texture and blend the hair. <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: How often should I cut my pixie haircut?</h3> A: It's recommended to get a trim every 4-6 weeks to maintain the shape of your pixie haircut. <h3>Q: Can I style my pixie haircut?</h3> A: Yes, there are many ways to style a pixie haircut, including adding texture, using hair accessories, and using styling products. <h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2> To maintain your pixie haircut, it's important to use the right hair care products.

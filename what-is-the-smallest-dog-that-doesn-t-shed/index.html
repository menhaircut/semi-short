Look for a breeder who is registered with a kennel club, and who has a good reputation in the community. Once you've found a breeder, it's important to ask questions about the dog's health history, temperament, and any potential health issues that may arise.</p><p>When you bring your Yorkie home, it's important to provide them with a comfortable and safe living space. This can be a crate or a small bed, depending on your dog's preference. You'll also need to provide them with food and water, as well as toys and treats to keep them entertained.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>1. Find a reputable breeder</p><p>2.

However, proper training can help to minimize excessive barking.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Yorkies have a long, silky, and hypoallergenic coat that requires regular grooming. This includes daily brushing to prevent tangles and mats, as well as regular baths to keep their coat clean and shiny.</p><p>You'll also need to trim their hair regularly, especially around their eyes and ears, to prevent irritation and infection.

But when it's only 60 degrees outside, you might be wondering if you should still wear shorts or opt for pants instead. In this article, we'll explore the pros and cons of wearing shorts in 60 degree weather, as well as provide some tips for staying comfortable and stylish no matter what you decide to wear.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>60 degree weather can be a bit tricky to dress for. It's not quite warm enough for shorts and a t-shirt, but it's not quite cold enough for a heavy jacket and pants. You might feel like you're stuck in the middle, unsure of what to wear. But don't worry, there are plenty of options that will keep you comfortable and fashionable no matter what the temperature is outside.</p><h2>How to</h2><h3>Option 1: Wear Shorts</h3><p>If you're set on wearing shorts, there are a few things you can do to make sure you stay comfortable. First, consider wearing longer shorts that hit just above the knee. This will help keep your legs warm and prevent them from feeling too exposed. You can also pair your shorts with a lightweight sweater or hoodie to add some extra warmth.</p><p>Another option is to wear leggings or tights underneath your shorts. This will not only keep you warm, but it will also add a fun pop of color or pattern to your outfit. Just make sure the leggings or tights fit well and don't bunch up under your shorts.</p><h3>Option 2: Wear Pants</h3><p>If you're not feeling the shorts vibe, pants are always a great option. Opt for lightweight fabrics like cotton or linen to keep you cool and comfortable. You can pair your pants with a short-sleeved shirt or blouse for a casual look, or dress them up with a blazer or cardigan for a more polished outfit.</p><h3>Option 3: Dress in Layers</h3><p>Layering is key when it comes to dressing for 60 degree weather. Start with a lightweight base layer like a tank top or t-shirt, and then add on a sweater, jacket, or scarf as needed. This way, you can easily adjust your outfit throughout the day if the temperature changes.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here are some steps you can follow to make sure you're dressed appropriately for 60 degree weather:</p><ol><li>Check the weather forecast to get an idea of what the temperature will be like throughout the day.</li><li>Choose an outfit based on the forecast, taking into account any activities you'll be doing.</li><li>If you're wearing shorts, consider wearing longer shorts or leggings/tights underneath for added warmth.</li><li>If you're wearing pants, choose lightweight fabrics like cotton or linen.</li><li>Layer your outfit with a sweater, jacket, or scarf to adjust for changes in temperature.</li></ol><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for dressing for 60 degree weather:</p><ul><li>Accessorize with a hat, sunglasses, or jewelry to add some personality to your outfit.</li><li>Choose comfortable shoes that are appropriate for your activities.</li><li>Don't forget to apply sunscreen if you'll be spending time outside.</li><li>Bring a lightweight jacket or sweater with you in case the temperature drops.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Is it okay to wear shorts in 60 degree weather?</h3><p>A: It really depends on your personal comfort level. Some people may feel perfectly comfortable wearing shorts in 60 degree weather, while others may prefer to wear pants or leggings for added warmth.</p><h3>Q: What should I wear with shorts in 60 degree weather?</h3><p>A: You can pair your shorts with a lightweight sweater or hoodie for added warmth.

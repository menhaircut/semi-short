Can wavy hair be frizzy?</h3><p>A. Yes, wavy hair can be frizzy. In fact, wavy hair is often more prone to frizz than straight hair because of its texture.</p><h3>Q. What causes frizzy hair?</h3><p>A. Frizzy hair is usually caused by a lack of moisture. When your hair is dry, the cuticles on each strand of hair become rough and raised, which can cause frizz.</p><h3>Q. How can I prevent frizz in my wavy hair?</h3><p>A. To prevent frizz in wavy hair, it's important to keep your hair moisturized. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, and apply a leave-in conditioner or styling product to help define your waves and keep them from getting frizzy.</p><h2 id="care">Overall Hair Care for Wavy Frizzy Hair</h2><p>Caring for wavy frizzy hair can be a challenge, but with the right products and techniques, it's definitely doable. Remember to look for sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners, and try to avoid using hot tools on your hair.
